# CISL HPC Allocations Panel

CISL's advisory panel on high-performance computing and services is the
CISL HPC Allocations Panel (CHAP). The CHAP's primary responsibility is
to assess the merit of large computing requests for CISL supercomputers
and related resources.

The panel accepts computing proposals from U.S. university researchers
in the atmospheric and closely related sciences who are supported by the
National Science Foundation (NSF). The CHAP recommends action with
respect to a prospective user's request on the basis of the
computational experimental design, computational effectiveness, and
availability of computing resources.

**The next university deadline for submitting Large Allocation Requests
is March 13, 2023.**

CHAP members, most of whom are from the university community, are
appointed to three-year terms by the CISL Director. Meetings are
scheduled twice a year, usually in May and October. NSF's program
coordinator for the NCAR and Facilities Section attends the semi-annual
meetings and provides guidance from the NSF.Â
