# Software on Cheyenne

Software environment modules on the Cheyenne system today are listed
below. (The output is from a **module spider** command.) To learn more
about a package or to see complete output for truncated lines (those
ending in **...**), run this on Cheyenne:

For detailed information about a specific package, include the version
number, as in this example:

module spider module_name/1.11

For a list of software modules and versions that are on the Casper data
analysis and visualization nodes, see: [<u>Casper software modules and

Contact CISL if you have suggestions for additional software to include
or if a module or package that you need is not available.
