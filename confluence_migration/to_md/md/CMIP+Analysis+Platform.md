# CMIP Analysis Platform

The CMIP Analysis Platform gives researchers convenient access to
climate data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) on
CISLâ€™s GLADE disk storage resource.

The tables below show which data sets are already available on GLADE.
They are updated each Friday.

If what you need is not already on GLADE, please review the additional
documentation in [**the Data Services
section**](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/computing-data/data/cmip-analysis-platform)
of the CISL web site and submit a request.
