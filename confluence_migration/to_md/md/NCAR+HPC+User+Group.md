# NCAR HPC User Group

The NCAR HPC User Group (NHUG) advises CISL on current and future HPC
systems, configurations and initiatives, including the need for training
and workshops on current HPC software, tools, and technologies. All
Cheyenne and Casper users are part of NHUG. We encourage you to join our
monthly meetings. Details are provided below.

## Communication channel

We maintain [NHUG Wiki](https://bit.ly/CISL-NHUG) to keep meeting
agendas, minutes, and so on. This channel complements our user service
offerings and is not a replacement for CISL [user
support](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/74318011) services. During
and before the meeting you may suggest discussion topics, ask questions
or simply upvote topics posted by your peers on the [NHUG Slido
page](http://www.slido.com/nhug). You can also participate in more
focused discussion by joining the [NHUG Slack
channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ncarhpcusergroup/shared_invite/zt-1232p8l8i-Ih_7~8023er2vGoQ2ddB2Q).

## Monthly meetings

Members join in monthly meetings on the first Tuesday of each month from
9-10 a.m. Mountain time.
