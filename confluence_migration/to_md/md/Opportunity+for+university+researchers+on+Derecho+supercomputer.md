***Updated 9/9/2022*** – Some project schedule details (below) are
temporarily unavailable pending delivery of Derecho hardware..

The ASD program provides a unique opportunity for a small group of
large-scale computational projects to have nearly exclusive use of the
Derecho system for a few months. During this time, ASD teams will work
closely with NCAR’s high-performance computing staff to optimize their
workflows, ensure that the environment is properly configured for
maximum efficiency, and demonstrate the capabilities of the
19.87-petaflops system.

For university participants in the ASD program, NCAR will make about 225
million core-hours available to five or six CPU-oriented projects and
225,000 GPU-hours to three or four GPU-oriented projects. The bulk of
the ASD computational runs should be completed during the first two
months after Derecho is accepted – that is, in May and June 2022 as
currently planned. 

The minimum scale of CPU-oriented projects is 30 million core-hours and
the minimum for GPU-oriented projects is 50,000 GPU-hours. Larger-scale
proposals and hybrid CPU/GPU proposals are encouraged. NCAR will provide
storage resources to support ASD projects during the computational and
analysis phases; long-term storage plans should be described in the
proposal.

#### Estimating Derecho allocation needs

Derecho users can expect to see a **1.3x** improvement over the Cheyenne
system's performance on a core-for-core basis. Therefore, to estimate
how many CPU core-hours will be needed for a project on Derecho,
multiply the total for a Cheyenne project by **0.77**.

When requesting an allocation for Derecho GPU nodes, please make your
request in terms of GPU-hours (number of GPUs used x wallclock hours).
We encourage researchers to estimate GPU-hour needs by making
test/benchmark runs on Casper GPUs, but will accept estimates based on
runs on comparable non-NCAR, GPU-based systems.

**Consulting and visualization support**

Accelerated Scientific Discovery (ASD) projects will be provided with
assistance on Derecho via dedicated staff members from the Consulting
Services Group. In addition, ASD projects will be granted allocations on
the Casper cluster as well as staff assistance in constructing
visualizations to improve understanding and presentation of results.
Please describe plans or estimated needs for data analysis and
visualization resources for your project.

## ASD eligibility, review considerations and support

To be eligible for an ASD allocation, the research team must have an
active NSF award that is generally consistent with the proposed ASD
activity and is within the atmospheric, climate, oceanographic, or
related sciences.

NCAR recognizes that conducting an ASD project places significant
demands on a research team. To encourage ASD proposals from the broadest
possible range of researchers and institutions, NCAR may be able to
provide dedicated, collaborative staffing time and effort to complement
a university team’s skill set. Interested researchers should contact the
ASD program coordinator, David Hart (<dhart@ucar.edu>) to discuss
possibilities for NCAR collaborative support ***before preparing an ASD
proposal***. Research teams led by or in collaboration with
minority-serving institutions (MSIs) or non-R1 institutions are strongly
encouraged.

ASD proposals will be reviewed by the CISL HPC Allocations Panel (CHAP),
and proposals should follow [the instructions for preparing large-scale
allocation
requests](file:////display/RC/University+Large+Allocation+Request+Preparation+Instructions).
In addition to the usual review criteria, the CHAP will closely assess
several other factors that must be addressed in the proposal:

- **Project readiness:** Successful proposals will have established,
  science-ready code and a team with sufficient experience to begin
  conducting full-scale runs on Day One.

- **Team commitment:** Successful proposals will demonstrate that the
  research team has staffing resources available to be committed to the
  ASD preparation and computing periods and to complete the primary
  science runs.

- **Analysis and data management plan:** Research teams need to show
  that they have staffing available to analyze the ASD model output and
  the resources available to handle long-term data management needs.
  NCAR will provide access to our analysis and storage resources for up
  to one year after the ASD computation period has ended.

## ASD proposal and project schedule

The ASD proposal and project schedule is outlined below. Research teams
must commit to have necessary staff members available for the various
ASD phases.

Some scheduling details are temporarily unavailable pending delivery of
Derecho hardware, which is now expected in late 2022.

| **July 1 – Sep. 10, 2021**  | University ASD proposals may be submitted.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
