# Advanced visualization support

Researchers who need help visualizing data to demonstrate the results of
their scientific computing can request expert assistance and
collaboration from CISL. This service is available to researchers who
want help using specialized applications on data analysis and
visualization resources that CISL manages.

CISL visualization staff have particular expertise in CISL-developed
software such as VAPOR and NCL but are open to assisting with other
applications. They have helped science teams produce numerous
visualizations for conferences, publications, and scientific journals as
well as science and broadcast news programs.

See these sites for some examples:

- [CISL Visualization Gallery](https://visgallery.ucar.edu/)

## Requesting support

To ask for assistance, please use [**this request
form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPDRkiPkEmaTVyEgE9MAPBqjj0jBiZiM4eP2FDV-p_fKJRkQ/viewform).
Indicate clearly that the request is for "Advanced Visualization
Support" and describe how the proposed visualization project meets the
following criteria:

- The assistance will culminate in a visualization deliverable or
  deliverables within a defined time period.

- The deliverable(s) will help demonstrate science results and findings.

- A member or members of the science team will participate actively in
  the production of the deliverable(s).

- Data to be visualized must have been generated on a CISL
  high-performance computing system.

- CISL data analysis and visualization resources will be used in
  creating the deliverables.

Requests for advanced visualization support are evaluated based on those
criteria to ensure the most productive use of the limited available
staff time. To further help us evaluate your request, please briefly
address the following questions when submitting the request form:

1.  What does the scientist want to communicate about the data with a
    visualization?

2.  What type of visualization is needed (2D or 3D animation, still
    images)?

3.  What model or instrument produced the data?

4.  How big are the data?

5.  In what file format are the data stored?

The CISL visualization staff will follow up with requesters directly if
additional details are needed.

## Starting visualization applications

CISL visualization experts can help as described above
with *using* applications such as NCL and VAPOR.

See the [Casper documentation](file:////display/RC/Casper+cluster) to
learn how to submit the necessary jobs and *start* the applications on
that data analysis and visualization cluster.
