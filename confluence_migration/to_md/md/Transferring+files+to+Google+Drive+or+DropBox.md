# Transferring files to Google Drive or DropBox

Researchers who store data on the GLADE system and need to share it with
colleagues who do not have GLADE access can do so with
[Globus](file:////display/RC/Sharing+data+and+making+unattended+transfers),
or with **Google Drive** or **DropBox** as explained below.

Users who are familiar with Amazon Web Services can also create a Globus
Amazon S3 endpoint for sharing data. Visit the [<u>Globus
site</u>](https://www.globus.org/connectors/s3) for more information.

### Google Drive

With the Google Drive client software installed on your local machine,
you can copy the files to a local folder that then syncs them to Google
Drive. Alternatively, you can copy GLADE files to your local machine and
then upload them to Google Drive as a separate step.

Follow these steps to share data using **Google Drive** installed
locally:

1.  Download and install [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/).

2.  Download and install [Globus Connect
    Personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal) and make
    your local computer a Globus endpoint.

3.  [Use Globus to copy your
    data](file:////display/RC/Globus+file+transfers) from GLADE to your
    local computer.

4.  Configure the files for sharing within Google Drive.

See [Google Drive Help](https://support.google.com/drive#topic=14940).

### DropBox

DropBox users who have installed the DropBox client on their local
machines can move files directly to DropBox in the same way as described
above for Google Drive.
