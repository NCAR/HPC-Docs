# Duo: Intermittent push and passcode issues

## Problem

My Duo push and passcode options work only intermittently.

## Solution

This might indicate that you have a weak connection at times.

1.  First, select "Call Me" if you need to log in immediately. (See
    image.) After you answer the call, press any key on your phone as
    instructed.

2.  Follow up by calling CISL at 303-497-2400 if the intermittent
    problems continue. Your phone may need to be reactivated.
