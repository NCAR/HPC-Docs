# ASD on Derecho: Soliciting NCAR projects

***Updated 9/9/2022*** – Scheduling details for Phase 4 (see below) are
temporarily unavailable pending delivery of Derecho hardware.

NCAR is seeking lab proposals for large-scale computational projects to
run on its next-generation “Derecho” HPC system in the Accelerated
Scientific Discovery (ASD) program. To be considered, ASD proposals must
align with objectives of the NCAR Strategic Plan. NCAR is seeking to
include both CPU-oriented and GPU-oriented projects.

Following Derecho acceptance testing, computational runs for the
selected projects are expected to be completed based on the Phase 4
timeline below. Project teams will have access to test systems in early
2022 in order to prepare. 

The ASD program provides a unique opportunity for large-scale
computational projects to have nearly exclusive use of the new
19.87-petaflops system for a few months, as the program did with
Derecho’s predecessors in 2017 (Cheyenne) and 2012 (Yellowstone).

Projects will be evaluated and selected based on the following
considerations and in the four-phase process described below. Key dates
to note:

- Lab-determined deadline: One-page proposals submitted for
  lab-specified review.

- July 26: Lab-prioritized one-page proposals due to NCAR Science
  Advisor

- October 1: Top projects selected for full proposal

- January 24: Full proposals due

- Early February: Proposal reviews complete

- March 1: NCAR EC approves final slate or projects

### Estimating Derecho allocation needs

Derecho users can expect to see a **1.3x** improvement over the Cheyenne
system's performance on a core-for-core basis. Therefore, to estimate
how many *CPU core-hours* will be needed for a project on Derecho,
multiply the total for a Cheyenne project by **0.77**.

When requesting an allocation for Derecho GPU nodes, please make your
request in terms of *GPU-hours* (number of GPUs used x wallclock hours).
Derecho GPU-hour estimates can be based on any reasonable GPU
performance estimate from another system, including Casper.

### Consulting and visualization support

Accelerated Scientific Discovery (ASD) projects will be provided with
assistance on Derecho via dedicated staff members from the Consulting
Services Group. In addition, ASD projects will be granted allocations on
the Casper cluster as well as staff assistance in constructing
visualizations to improve understanding and presentation of results.
Please describe plans or estimated needs for data analysis and
visualization resources for your project.

## Selection considerations

The final portfolio of ASD projects will span a range of domains and
strategic priorities. Roughly 225M core-hours and 225k GPU-hours will be
allocated to NCAR-led ASD projects. Minimum allocation size should be
roughly 30M core-hours or 50k GPU-hours.

The following considerations will be evaluated during the strategic
assessment phases. Projects are ***not*** expected to
address ***all*** of these considerations.

- Actionable science, including but not limited to those explicitly
  stated in section 3.3 of the NCAR Strategic Plan.

- Connections to NCAR’s cross-lab activities, including the Boundary
  Layer Initiative, Short-Term Explicit Prediction (STEP), System for
  Integrated Modeling of the Atmosphere (SIMA), the NCAR Water System
  Program, convergent science, and Earth System predictability.

- External collaborators committing time and effort during modeling or
  analysis phases. Lab collaborations with faculty and students at MSIs
  and non-R1 universities is encouraged.

- Workforce development or training components (for example, inclusion
  of postdocs, grad students).

- Long-term, community value of resulting data sets, such as the
  generation of landmark simulations.

## Phase 1: Ideas and one-page proposals

NCAR lab staff are asked to submit ideas to their lab directors for
possible ASD projects of appropriate scale and strategic NCAR value.
Researchers/teams should produce a short project description (1 page or
less) that outlines:

1.  How the project meets ASD strategic criteria and considerations.

2.  Estimated compute scale and data management needs.

3.  Code and team readiness.

4.  Staffing/funding availability or challenges.

Labs will submit up to four one-page proposals by July 26 to NCAR
Science Advisor Glen Romine and ASD Coordinator Dave Hart.

## Phase 2: Strategic review and selection

Labs’ project ideas will be reviewed by a panel chaired by the NCAR
Science Advisor with members from the NCAR Scientist Assembly and Early
Career Scientist Assembly. The panel will select a portfolio of projects
based on:

1.  ASD strategic criteria and considerations.

2.  Collective breadth of strategic coverage. 

3.  Preliminary readiness assessment.

4.  Approximate fit within the compute time and storage space available
    to ASD.

The final slate of projects will include a small set of projects to be
“on deck” in the event other projects are unable to proceed. 

## Phase 3: Proposal preparation and final review

The review panel will consider how well the proposed experiments address
the stated science objectives, the efficiency of the proposed runs,
correctness of expected cost and data needs calculations, and the
projects’ readiness for science runs in the ASD window.

All projects that proceed to this phase are likely to be approved to run
on Derecho at some point, barring the discovery of significant issues.
If not approved as ASD projects, some could be considered as NCAR
Strategic Capability (NSC) projects.

Final selection of ASD projects will be announced at the end of August.

## Phase 4: ASD period

Scheduling details for this phase are temporarily unavailable pending
delivery of Derecho hardware, which is now expected in late 2022.

| **TBD** | ASD teams begin primary computational runs on Derecho following system acceptance.                                                                                   |

| **TBD** | ASD science runs should be largely completed; some continued access will be available to complete projects that are making good progress. ASD analysis phase begins. |
| **TBD** | ASD projects expected to complete analysis phase and migrate data for long-term preservation.                                                                        |
