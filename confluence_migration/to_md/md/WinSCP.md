# WinSCP

WinSCP offers a choice of GUI interfaces for managing files. It is easy
to download and install
from [winscp.net](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php).

Starting the application will bring you to a login screen like the one
shown here. (Highlights added.)

To start a session, input the **host name** and your **username **for
that system.

Leave the password field blank, and click **Login**.

The first time you log in to a system, you may get a dialog box like
this:

Click **Yes **to continue.

Next, you will be asked for your **Token_Response**. Follow your
regular [authentication
procedures](file:////display/RC/Authentication+and+security).

If you’re using the “Commander” interface (shown below), WinSCP will
display the contents of your local system on the left side of your
screen and the contents of your remote system home directory on the
right. You can manage files using typical Windows commands and tools.

The alternative “Explorer” interface displays only the remote folder,
and you can transfer files by dragging and dropping from Windows File
Explorer. On the WinSCP menu, go
to **Options/Preferences/Environment/Interface** to use it.
