# Recover lost or deleted files

There are two ways to recover files you have lost or deleted from your
GLADE **home** file space:

1.  Follow the procedures documented here to recover them
    yourself: [Recovering files from
    snapshots](file:////display/RC/Recovering+files+from+snapshots).

2.  Submit a request to the [NCAR Research Computing help
    desk](https://rchelp.ucar.edu/) to ask for recovery of your files
    from a backup of your **/glade/u/home/username** directory.

No backups are made of GLADE spaces other than /glade/u/home. Files lost
from other spaces cannot be recovered.
