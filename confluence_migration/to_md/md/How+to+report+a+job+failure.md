# How to report a job failure

CISL staff ask that you provide the information listed below when you
report the failure of a Cheyenne or Casper job. This information will
help us find a solution as quickly as possible.

It is also important to preserve any input files, binaries and
executables in the directories as they were when the problem occurred.

### Include the following in your [help desk ticket](https://ithelp.ucar.edu/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/3/create/35):

1.  Cluster used (Cheyenne or Casper)

2.  Job ID

3.  Error message received

4.  Full GLADE pathname of the job script

5.  Full GLADE pathname of the job's standard error and output files

6.  Environment modules loaded when compiling and running the job
    (output of **module list** command)
