## Documentation

Search for relevant documentation with the "Search" field at upper-right or use one of the service desk links below to submit a help request (login required). Where a login is required, use your NCAR/UCAR username and CIT password. Users who do not have CIT passwords (non-NCAR/UCAR staff members, for example) can reset their passwords [here](https://crowd.ucar.edu/crowd/console/login.action#/forgot-password) or call 303-497-2400 for assistance.

## NCAR Research Computing help desk

Contact [the help desk](https://rchelp.ucar.edu/) for assistance with Cheyenne, Casper, and related data-storage systems.

## Enterprise Service Desk staff support
The [Enterprise Service Desk portal](https://help.ucar.edu/) is for NCAR/UCAR staff who need support for internal IT services.

CISL staff ask that you provide the information listed below when you
report the failure of a Cheyenne or Casper job. This information will
help us find a solution as quickly as possible.


### Best Practices for Support Tickets

When submitting a [support ticket](https://rchelp.ucar.edu) please include as much detail as possible to enable quicker resolution. It is also important to preserve any input files, binaries and executables in the directories as they were when the problem occurred.


- Resource name (Derecho, Casper, JupyterHub,...),

- **Exact** error messages and/or paths to error output,

- Batch script location,

- PBS JobID(s) of failed effort,

- Run & source directory paths (ideally UNIX-readable by ‘others’),

- Any other pertinent information:

    - Last time this exact workflow was successful, if any (or changes since last success),

    - Troubleshooting steps already attempted, etc.

***And please remember to let us know when your issue is resolved!***
