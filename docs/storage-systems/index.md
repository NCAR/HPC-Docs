# Storage Resources, Data Transfer, and Data Access Resources


CISL provides several broad classes of storage resources and data access mechanisms.
Follow the links below for additional information.

## Storage Resources
- [GLADE](./glade/index.md) for typical POSIX file system use
- [Quasar](./quasar/index.md) is a cold, tape-based archive for storing curated data collections that have an indefinite lifetime.
- [Stratus](./stratus/index.md) is an object storage disk system for long-term data storage.

## Data Access and Data Transfer

- Dedicated [data-access](./data-access-nodes.md) for facilitating data transfers.
- Tools such as [Globus](./data-transfer/globus/index.md), and [`scp`, `sftp`, `bbcp`](./data-transfer/scp-and-sftp.md) for performing large data set transfers.
