# CMIP Analysis Platform

The CMIP Analysis Platform gives researchers convenient access to
climate data from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) on
CISLâ€™s GLADE disk storage resource.

!!! note
    The tables below show which data sets are already available on GLADE.
    They are updated each Friday.  These data are be located under
    ```pre
    /glade/campaign/collections/cmip.mirror/
    ```

## Downloading additional data sets
If what you need is not already on GLADE, the `esgfsearch` and
`esgfdownload` tools may be used to download additional data sets.
These tools are based on the
[intake-esgf](https://intake-esgf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project.

This process assumes you are familiar with the typical CMIP *facets* and associated nomenclature, if not please refer to the [intake-esgf beginners guide](https://intake-esgf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/beginner.html) for an introduction or review the [CMIP6 Core Controlled Vocabularies](https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/CMIP6_CVs/) for additional details.

### Searching
The `esgfsearch` tool can be used to identify available data sets and
refine matching criteria prior to initiating the download
process. `esgfsearch` is configured to identify existing data in our
shared `/glade/campaign/collections/cmip.mirror/` repository and only
download additional data when necessary.

!!! example "Using `esgfsearch`"

    **Search Criterion**

    `esgfsearch` takes a number of command-line arguments matching CMIP facet nomenclature.
    In this case we will look for a single variable, `tas`, which represents the near-surface air temperature.
    We restrict the search to the `historical` experiment for two different model sources, at a monthly output frequency.

    ```pre
    $ esgfsearch \
        --experiment_id historical \
        --source_id CanESM5 CESM2 \
        --frequency mon \
        --variable_id tas
    ```
    For a complete list of search parameters, run `esgfsearch --help`.

    **Search Output**

    The example above produces the following output:
    ```pre
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Calling ESGFCatalog().search() with arguments:
    #        project : ['CMIP6']
    #      source_id : ['CanESM5', 'CESM2']
    #  experiment_id : ['historical']
    #      frequency : ['mon']
    #    variable_id : ['tas']
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Determining file sizes...
    --> Search found 91 total files / 5.67 GiB
    --> Existing: 29 files / 2.64 GiB
    --> Download required: 62 files / 3.03 GiB
    ```

    The output repeats the search criteria and previews the matching data in a table format. The final lines show:

    1. The total number and volume of files matching the search criteria,
    2. the subset of these files already existing on GLADE, and
    3. the amount of data that must be downloaded to complete the request.

    ---

    By default `esgfsearch` will match all known `member_id` for a
    given search, which may result in much more data than necessary
    depeding on your use case. When only a single variant is required,
    commonly `r1i1p1f1`; this can be selected with the
    `--member_id` search argument.

### Downloading

When you are satisfied with your search criteria, simply replace the
`esgfsearch` command shown above with `esgfdownload` to begin the download
process. These files will be placed into a temporary staging directory
and then copied into the shared repository for general user access,
with these temporary copies being removed automatically 7 days later.
We recommend creating a shell script with the final syntax so that it
can be repeated easily if necessary, or restarted if the download
process is interrupted.

!!! warning "Check your scratch space!"
    Downloading additional data requires you have adequate scratch space available.
    Use `gladequota` [as described here](glade/index.md#gladequota-command) to determine your
    available scratch space and make sure it is large enough to
    accommodate the "download required" data volume reported by
    `esgfsearch`.

Large queries may result in thousands of files and a terabyte (or more)
of data, which may take several hours to completely download.  If the
download is interrupted, simply restarting the process should pick up
again, recognizing previously downloaded items.

By default any new files into a temporary staging path at `/glade/campaign/collections/cmip.mirror/.tmp/${USER}/`.
A system process looks for new user downloads and ingest files into the shared
`/glade/campaign/collections/cmip.mirror/` space, running several
times daily.  Once these files are available in the shared repository
you may manually delete your downloads to immediately regain scratch
quota, or simply wait for the system to automatically remove your
temporary staged files 7 days after last access time.
