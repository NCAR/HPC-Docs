# Software for HPC users


NCAR and CISL have developed and support a number of freely available
software packages for visualization, data analysis, weather prediction,
and high-performance computation. These include models that help
researchers understand the impact of regional and global climate change,
and tools and libraries for analyzing and visualizing data.

Software available on the HPC and data analysis systems that CISL
operates also includes open-source and commercial third-party products
used for programming, analysis, and file management tasks.
