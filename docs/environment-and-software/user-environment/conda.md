# Using Conda

!!! note "Updated 12/21/2022"
    This documentation has been revised to include the
    new update schedule for the NCAR Python Library as well as information
    for determining when to use managed environments vs. when to create your
    own environments.

NCAR system users access Python via
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)
environments, which are self-contained installations of Python itself,
Python packages, and the software dependencies those packages rely on.
The Conda environment manager is accessible by loading an environment
module as described below.

After loading the module, you can create your own environments or use
NCAR Python Library (NPL) environments, which include Python 3.9 and a
wide array of pre-installed geoscience, math, and computing packages.

## Python and Conda

Python is one of the most popular languages for scientific data
analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Not only is it
well-suited for such applications, one of its main strengths is the
availability of supported and well-made third-party libraries for many
different applications. These libraries, which include a collection of
Python modules and software, can be installed into a Python
environment.

While various methods and tools are available for managing Python
environments, CISL recommends using Conda to manage them on NCAR
systems. If Python packages are not managed carefully, the environments
may suffer from incompatibilities between chosen packages and even cause
problems for other applications. One of the key concerns is dependency
management.

Many Python users are already familiar with
[Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html), a
sophisticated package manager that eases the burden of setting Python up
to do scientific analysis. While it is not difficult to install Conda
yourself, we provide a Conda environment module on all of our systems to
let you skip that step.

The version of Conda that the module provides is updated frequently and
also includes [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). (Mamba
is a re-implementation of Conda with a similar interface and it is
typically much faster and more robust at creating environments from
complex sets of requirements). Once loaded, the Conda module:

- provides access to `conda` and `mamba` commands.

- allows you to run `conda activate` without initializing Conda in
  your startup files.

- adds managed environments to your list of available Python
  environments.

- sets sensible default behaviors for Conda, such as making
  `conda-forge` the default package
  [channel](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html),
  locating your [cached package downloads](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/dev-guide/deep-dives/install.html?highlight=cache#download-and-extraction)
  in your scratch space, and locating your personal Python environments
  in your work space.

!!! warning "System-wide and personal `conda` installations"
    If you already have a personal
    [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installation
    initialized in your environment, the Conda module will take precedence
    only when it is loaded. To use your own install instead, simply unload
    the module. You can also override or augment our Conda configuration
    settings by defining your own in a
    [`~/.condarc`](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html)
    file.

For more information on using Conda, consider exploring the [official
documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/).
Additionally, the [Conda Cheat Sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/cheatsheet.html)
is a helpful quick reference that covers the commands most users will
need.

## Accessing Python via Conda

Once you have the Conda module loaded, you can start using Python a
number of ways. It is easy and often convenient to activate one of the
environments CISL provides, such as the NCAR Python Library (NPL).
However, you may wish to craft an environment that contains only the
packages you care about, or use specific versions of different packages.
Conda makes this process relatively straightforward. Both approaches are
detailed in the following sections.

### Using managed environments

You can access a number of pre-installed Python environments by loading
the Conda module. To see available environments, run the `list`
subcommand:
```bash
conda env list
```

The output will include both managed environments and any personal
environments you have created, provided they are in Condaâ€™s search path.

#### The NCAR Python Library
Our primary managed environment is the NCAR Python Library (**NPL**),
which contains a large collection of packages related to geoscience
and data processing. (It does not currently contain GPU or machine
learning packages.) The NPL can be accessed as follows:
```bash
conda activate npl
```

Once the environment is activated, the `python` command in your shell
will use the version provided by the NPL. Currently, it is version
Python 3.8, which is supported by the majority of relevant packages.
Once package compatibility improves in newer versions, the NPL will be
updated.

To see the full list of packages in a managed environment, run the
following command:
```bash
conda list --name npl-2022b
```

##### Update schedule for the NCAR Python Library

The NPL is updated twice a year and identified with environment names
such as `npl-2022b` and `npl-2023a`. New NPL versions contain the
same collection of packages as the previous environments (plus any
requested and approved additions), but we let the Mamba resolver find
and use the latest compatible versions of each package.

For convenience, we also provide an environment named `npl` that always
points to the most recent version of the NPL. We recommend that you load
a specific version instead if you want to ensure consistent behavior
from each installed package.

### Creating your own Conda environment

There are many reasons you might prefer to install your own Conda
environment rather than use one of the managed environments mentioned
above. These may include:

- Preferring a small collection of relevant packages

- Existing workflows that create environments

- Faster or irregular package update cadence

- Desiring your own specified matrix of Python and package versions

- Maximizing stability in a package development environment

To install your own environment using Conda:

1.  Load our Conda module (or use your own Miniconda install)

2.  Use `mamba create` to [create an
    environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html?highlight=init#creating-an-environment-with-commands)
    from a set of requirements, as in the following example:
```bash
mamba create -n my-env python=3.9 numpy scipy matplotlib pandas
geocat-comp wrf-python
```
That command will create a new environment called `my-env` with a
recent version of Python 3.9.x. (you can choose a different Python
version than the NPL when creating your own environments) and a small
number of useful geoscience packages (plus any dependencies that Mamba
determines are needed). The environment would be located in
`/glade/work/$USER/conda-envs/my-env` if you are using the CISL Conda
module.

!!! note "Mamba and Conda interoperability"
    In general, any Conda command can be executed with Mamba instead. In
    practice, it is only beneficial to use Mamba when creating environments
    and installing packages. The Mamba developers currently *advise against
    using it* to activate environments.

### Using Conda in batch jobs

The Conda module enables Python environment activation by setting a
shell alias that calls initialization scripts. However, the alias does
not carry over into batch jobs or other subshells. You can address this
one of two ways:

1.  Explicitly load the Conda module at the start of your batch job.
    This will restore the alias in the shell environment and allow you
    to activate Conda environments.

2.  Run `conda init` (or `conda init tcsh` for tcsh users) after
    loading the module on a login node. That will add initialization
    commands to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.tcshrc` file. Be aware that
    `~/.bashrc` is not always sourced at the start of batch jobs, so
    this approach may require some trial and error to cover your
    individual use case.

## Reproducing Conda environments

### Cloning an environment

It is possible to
[clone](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html?highlight=init#cloning-an-environment)
any environment in your `conda env list` using Mamba. For example, to
clone the personal environment we created above, use the following
command:
```bash
mamba create -n my-clone --clone my-env
```

Assuming the clone is created on the same file system (e.g., your
`conda-envs`), it will use very little space as Mamba will attempt to use
[hard links](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/dev-guide/deep-dives/install.html?highlight=hard%20link#linking-the-files-in-the-environment)
to avoid duplication.

### Using YAML files

Sometimes it is useful to create an environment from the [environment file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html?highlight=init#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
of another environment. This allows Mamba to resolve all package
requirements at the same time, which can produce more coherent
environments and avoid situations in which the dependency resolver fails
to find a solution. If the cloning method described above fails or seems
to be taking too long, try this approach instead. Other benefits include
having a hard copy of the specifications of an environment that you can
share with colleagues, install on other systems, and version track with
software like Git.

First, use Conda to produce the YAML environment file from an existing
environment. This example uses the NPL:
```pre
conda env export [--from-history] -n npl > npl-environment.yml
```

If you use the `--from-history` option, only packages that you
explicitly request will be specified in the file, letting Conda choose
newer dependencies for future environments. If you *do not* specify that
option, all packages including dependencies will be documented
explicitly in the YAML file. After creating the YAML file, you can use a
text editor to make additions and changes to the package list; package
additions and changes will be reflected in any new environments you
create from the modified YAML file.

You can then create new environments from the YAML file using Mamba:
```bash
mamba env create -f npl-environment.yml -n my-npl
```
!!! warning
    Large environments like the NPL can take a long time to clone or
    recreate using YAML files.

## Using Conda environments in Jupyter

Managed environments can be accessed easily in a
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) session using
the [NCAR JupyterHub](../../compute-systems/jupyterhub/index.md) service.
Once you initiate a JupyterHub server, the managed kernels mentioned
above (e.g., `NPL 2022b`) should be visible on the main launcher page.
You can use them to run both Notebooks and Consoles.

### Creating Jupyter kernels for your environments

There are two ways to make your environments accessible in a Jupyter
interface like NCARâ€™s JupyterHub. Both involve creating a kernel for the
environment.

First, install the `ipykernel` package into your environment:
```bash
conda activate my-env
mamba install ipykernel
```

At this point, your environment should show up automatically as a kernel
in any Jupyter server on Cheyenne or Casper. This method is convenient
and robust, and any shell settings (e.g., environment variables) needed
by packages [will be
set](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/dev-guide/deep-dives/activation.html?highlight=activate.d#activation-deactivation-scripts)
upon kernel launch.

You can also [manually
create](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments)
a JSON-format kernel specification file in your home directory and give
it a custom name using the `ipykernel` module. This approach allows
you to share environments with colleagues, as they can simply activate
your Conda environment on the command line and then create their own
personal Jupyter kernel. With your environment activated, run the
following:
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my-kernel
```

!!! warning
    Kernels created using this approach will not have the previously
    mentioned shell settings imposed by `conda activate`, which may result
    in some packages (e.g., `pyproj`) not functioning properly.
