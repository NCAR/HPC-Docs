# Personalizing start files

You can personalize your NCAR high-performance computing environment by
using the sample content below in your startup files â€“ the files that
create your interactive login shell. The examples provide alternative
color schemes and set some commonly used aliases.

These examples also demonstrate how to define commands to be run
for *interactive sessions only* and commands to be run for *all new
shells*. This distinction can be important if you have some commands in
your initialization files that would be disruptive for non-interactive
connections, such as when using the `scp` command (which is not
interactable and therefore will not benefit from module loads or
aliases) or within a batch script.

If you use bash or ksh, edit your `.profile` file. If you use tcsh,
edit your `.tcshrc` file. PBS jobs on NCAR systems initialize your job
environment with those files, so do not confuse them
with `.bashrc` and `.login` files, which have different purposes and
are not always sourced at login time.)

Personalizing these files is optional; the information is provided in
response to users' requests.

!!! danger "Keep the following in mind when writing/revising your initialization files"

    - Consider making backup copies of your existing startup files before
      creating customized files.

    - If you source other scripts in your initialization files, be sure to
      provide an absolute path to the file (or a consistent reference path
      like `source ~/commands` instead of `source commands`). That way,
      the script will execute correctly whether it is run from a session
      within your home directory or anywhere else on the file systems.

    - It is best to include only those commands and settings in your
      initialization files that are generic to all work you perform.
      Examples of these include environment variables and `module
      load` commands. Any settings specific to a particular workflow, or
      settings others may need to run your jobs, should be included in
      relevant shell and PBS batch scripts rather than in your
      initialization files.

    - Some programs (conda, for example) insert initialization instructions
      into your startup files. These instructions will be executed for most
      new shells, including at the start of your PBS jobs.
