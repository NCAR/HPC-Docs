# Machine learning and deep learning

CISL provides several libraries for users' machine learning and deep
learning (ML/DL) work.

These libraries have been compiled from source to use native CUDA (GPU)
and MPI libraries, increasing the capabilities over downloadable
distributions that are available online. The ML/DL library installations
can be found in the [NCAR Python Library](./user-environment/conda.md#the-ncar-python-library).

The libraries available are:

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine learning library
  v2.3.1

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) machine learning library v1.7.1

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning library
  v0.5.3

- [Horovod](https://eng.uber.com/horovod/) deep learning framework
  v0.21.0

- [Keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library v2.4.3
