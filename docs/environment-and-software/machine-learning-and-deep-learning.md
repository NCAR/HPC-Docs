# Machine learning and deep learning

CISL does not currently provide pre-built conda environments for machine learning or deep learning (ML/DL) workflows. We currently have a [github repository](https://github.com/NCAR/aiml_gpu_ncar_envs) with convenience scripts for installing various popular machine learning libraries on NCAR HPC systems, including Derecho and Casper. In the future we hope to offer pre-built virtual environments for all HPC users at NCAR, accessible via conda activate.
