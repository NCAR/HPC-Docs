# Casper batch job script examples

These PBS batch script examples work for executables generated by any
compiler and MPI library installed on *Casper*. (The defaults are Intel
and OpenMPI, respectively.) Remember to substitute your own job name and
project code, and customize the other directives and commands as
necessary.

The examples are similar to PBS examples for running jobs on *Derecho*.
For help with any of them, contact the [NCAR Research Computing help desk](https://rchelp.ucar.edu/).

When your script is ready, submit your batch job from a *Casper* login
node by using the `qsub` command followed by the name of your script
file.
```bash
qsub script_name
```

<!-- You can also submit your batch script from a Cheyenne login node to -->
<!-- Casper by using the **qsubcasper** command. All other steps are the -->
<!-- same. -->
<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- qsubcasper script_name -->
<!-- ``` -->
