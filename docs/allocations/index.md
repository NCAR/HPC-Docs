# Allocations


The Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) provides large-scale computing resources for university researchers and NCAR scientists in the atmospheric and related sciences. To access these supercomputers, storage systems, and other resources, users must apply for allocations via the processes defined for each community.

Applications are reviewed and time is allocated according to the needs of the projects and the availability of resources. Send questions about the following allocation opportunities to alloc@ucar.edu.

!!! info
	The next university deadline for submitting Large Allocation Requests is March 13, 2023.

## University allocation opportunities

NCAR provides computing resources to the university community for investigations that are beyond the scope of university computing centers. The CISL HPC Advisory Panel (CHAP) accepts requests for large allocations of NCAR resources every six months, in March and September.

See University allocations for details.

!!! info
	**Eligibility.** In general, any U.S.-based researcher with an NSF award in the atmospheric sciences or computational science in support of the atmospheric sciences is eligible to apply for a University Community allocation. There are some limited opportunities for those without NSF awards.

## Wyoming-NCAR Alliance

The NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center represents a collaboration between NCAR and the University of Wyoming. As part of the Wyoming-NCAR Alliance (WNA), a portion of the Cheyenne system – about 160 million core-hours per year – is reserved for Wyoming-led projects and allocated by a University of Wyoming-managed process.

Details of the Wyoming process are available at the [University of Wyoming web site](#).

## NCAR lab allocation opportunities

NCAR investigators have access to CISL resources through allocations to the NCAR labs and have opportunities to submit requests for larger-scale, project-oriented allocations. Proposals for larger-scale projects are reviewed twice per year to become NCAR Strategic Capability projects.

See [NCAR allocations](#) for more details.
