# Allocations


The U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR) provides large-scale computing resources for university researchers and NSF NCAR scientists to pursue work in the Earth system sciences and related sciences. To access these supercomputers, storage systems, and other resources, users must apply for allocations via the processes defined for each community.

Applications are reviewed and time is allocated according to the needs of the projects and the availability of resources. Send questions about the following allocation opportunities to alloc@ucar.edu.

!!! info
	The next university deadline for submitting Large Allocation Requests will be September 10, 2024.

## University allocations

NSF NCAR provides computing resources to the university community for research and classroom instruction in the Earth system sciences and related areas. Requests for several types of small-scale projects can be submitted anytime and are usually handled within a few days. The CISL HPC Advisory Panel (CHAP) accepts requests for large allocations of NSF NCAR resources every six months, in March and September.

See [University Allocations](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/allocations/university-allocations/) for details.

!!! info
	**Eligibility.** In general, any U.S.-based researcher with an NSF award in the Earth system sciences or related to Earth system science is eligible to apply for a University allocation. We also offer some opportunities for graduate students, postdocs, and faculty who do not have NSF awards.

## Wyoming-NCAR Alliance

The NSF NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center represents a collaboration between NSF NCAR and the University of Wyoming. As part of the Wyoming-NCAR Alliance (WNA), a portion of the Derecho system is reserved for Wyoming-led projects and allocated by a University of Wyoming-managed process.

Details of the Wyoming process are available at the [University of Wyoming website](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/index.html).

## NSF NCAR lab allocations

NSF NCAR investigators have access to CISL resources through allocations to the NSF NCAR labs and have opportunities to submit requests for larger-scale, project-oriented allocations. Proposals for larger-scale projects are reviewed twice per year to become NCAR Strategic Capability projects.

See [NSF NCAR allocations](https://arc.ucar.edu/xras_submit/opportunities) for more details.
