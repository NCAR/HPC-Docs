# NSF NCAR Strategic Capability (NSC) projects

**The next NSC submission deadline will be September 15, 2025.**

NSF NCAR Strategic Capability (NSC) allocations target large-scale projects lasting 
one year to a few years that align with NSF NCAR’s scientific priorities and 
strategic plans. These large-scale, high-priority projects are subject to review 
of their scientific merit, strategic importance, technical readiness, and broader 
impact. NSF NCAR researchers and computational scientists are encouraged to submit 
requests for NSF NCAR Strategic Capability (NSC) projects to be run on the Derecho system. 

NSC proposals are accepted and reviewed every six months, in spring and fall. 
Proposals should follow the guidance in these [instructions for preparing proposal 
documents](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/allocations/university-allocations/university-large-allocation-request-preparation-instructions/),
which apply to NSC project requests as well as to large university 
requests. NSC projects requiring more than one year’s allocation must submit 
continuation (renewal) proposals each year to report progress toward the 
project’s objectives and request the coming year’s allocation.

Potential submitters should apply to the NSC opportunity that best aligns 
with their project's anticipated timetable and readiness. In most cases, 
a project should consider the opportunity that starts shortly **after** their 
planned start, so that preliminary and benchmarking results can be submitted 
as part of the NSC proposal. A project for the same or similar work can 
receive an allocation only once a year.

To be considered for an NSC allocation, a proposed project:

* should relate to one or more specific priorities in the current [NSF NCAR Strategic Plan](https://ncar.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/documents/related-links/2020-06/NCAR_StrategicPlan_2020-24_Final.pdf).
* must be ready to begin production runs from the start of the allocation period. (Lab allocations can be used to perform benchmarking and test runs, and proposals should provide sufficient details to convince reviewers of the project's readiness.)
* must require significant computational resources, typically above and beyond the 10 million core-hour or 25,000 GPU-hours minimum levels.
* should have a well-defined scope and completion timeline.
* may be linked to an agency funding award or awards separate from NSF NCAR base funding.

## NSC eligibility
All NSC project requests must have a full or part-time regular NSF NCAR staff 
member with an R or T appointment as project lead. In order for term employees 
to be eligible as project leads, the period of performance of the project should 
not extend beyond the employee's term date. Labs may choose to implement policies 
to coordinate the submissions from the lab in each request period. Joint work 
with university collaborators is eligible. Projects that span labs are encouraged, 
though a single project lead should be identified.

NSC allocations typically have a minimum request size of 10 million core-hours 
or 25,000 GPU-hours; exceptions can be granted for cause. Contact 
alloc@ucar.edu to discuss a possible exception. There is no maximum size limit, 
though in practice the review process will attempt to accommodate all meritorious 
submissions at some level, which may require reducing the amounts awarded to 
some projects. Consistent with the NSC objectives, NSC requests should not aggregate 
many smaller projects out of the same lab to meet the minimum request limit.

Because of the competitive nature of these allocations, labs may have chosen 
to coordinate submissions from each lab. Potential applicants are encouraged to 
contact their lab's or division's allocation representative before submitting a 
request.

## NSC proposal format
NSC requests must prepare Proposal Documents, which should follow the guidance 
and structure for [large allocation requests for universities](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/allocations/university-allocations/university-large-allocation-request-preparation-instructions/). 
Notably, NSC requests must include a five-page summary along with relevant supporting documentation.

For those projects requiring more than one year’s allocation, a continuation request 
will need to be submitted as part of the next year’s NSC request and review process. 
The continuation request should include a short progress write-up according to the 
instructions for large allocation requests.

!!! info 
          Long-term storage plans for NSC project data in Campaign Storage should be coordinated with the requester's lab(s). 
          The data management plan section in your NSC request document should describe the arrangements made with your lab.

## Review process and schedule 
NSC requests are reviewed twice per year. Projects arising too late for NSC 
consideration will either need to wait, identify bridging allocations from NSF NCAR labs, 
or apply for startup allocations via the NSF NCAR Director’s Reserve. Such NSC pre-awards 
must satisfy the criteria for a Director’s Reserve award.

NSC requests are reviewed by a panel of computational scientists composed of 
representatives of each NSF NCAR lab and program who are appointed by the lab and program 
directors. This panel evaluates proposals according to the [three criteria used by 
the CHAP](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/allocations/chap/chap-allocation-review-criteria/) 
in its evaluation of large university requests – the effectiveness of the 
methodology, the appropriateness of the research plan, and the efficiency of resource 
use. The technical readiness description also provides input into this aspect of 
the evaluation.

The relationship between the proposed projects and NSF NCAR’s strategic priorities 
is assessed by the NSF NCAR Directorate. This strategic assessment informs the 
priority ranking for NSC requests, which may be used when proposal requests 
exceed available resources to defer the start of some projects.

Should any awarded project encounter issues that require it to stop work or 
be unable to complete its proposed work, additional allocation awards may be 
made to unawarded requests in order of priority rank and as resource availability permits.
