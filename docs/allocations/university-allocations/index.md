# University allocations

!!! tip "The next university deadline for submitting Large Allocation Requests will be March 10, 2025."

University use of the NSF NCAR HPC environment is intended to support Earth
system science and related research and instruction by researchers and
educators at U.S. institutions. The emphasis is on projects that may be beyond
the scope of a university’s local computing capabilities. Eligible
researchers and activities incur no costs to use NSF NCAR resources.

**Important.** For large and small projects based on a supporting NSF award,
the NSF award must explicitly support the computational experiments being proposed.

We provide a range of opportunities to meet the needs of University researchers.
In addition to supercomputing access for Earth systems science researchers,
we also have a Data Analysis opportunity for analyzing NSF NCAR-hosted data sets.

While we often distinguish between the allocation opportunities based on
the size of the HPC resource needs, most of these options also allow you to
request data analysis, visualization, and storage resources.

The table below summarizes the HPC resource limits for each type of allocation.
For Small, Exploratory, and Classroom projects, the amounts shown assume use of
only Derecho or Derecho GPU. For requests to use both parts of Derecho,
proportionally smaller limits apply—e.g., up to half the Derecho limit
and half the Derecho GPU limit can be requested together.

**Submitting Your Request.** For all types of university allocations,
including any subsequent extension or supplement requests, requests should be
submitted via the [ARC portal’s Allocations section](https://arc.ucar.edu/xras_submit/opportunities).
If you have questions about these options, please contact us via the [Research
Computing help](https://rchelp.ucar.edu) desk.

## Large Allocations

A university researcher may submit a large request for work that is
beyond the scope of the amounts available via Small allocation requests.
These requests have no upper limit, aside from the portion of the system
available to the university community and ensuring that we can support
the breadth of work from eligible university researchers. As noted above,
the NSF award must explicitly support the computational experiments
planned for the large allocation.

CISL accepts requests for large allocations of NSF NCAR resources every six
months, in March and September. Deadlines for submitting requests are
announced approximately two months in advance. The CISL HPC Allocations
Panel ([CHAP](../chap/index.md)) reviews
requests in April and October, and projects begin in May and November.

!!! note
    We strongly recommend that researchers begin any new project
    by submitting a Small allocation request first. With a Small allocation,
    you can get started quickly and conduct benchmark and test runs to
    confirm the estimated computational costs of your planned model
    configurations. Such preparatory work will maximize your success during
    CHAP review.

The panel recommends awards on the basis of the computational
experimental design, computational effectiveness, and availability of
computing resources (see [Review
Criteria](../chap/chap-allocation-review-criteria.md)). Check the
[submission instructions](university-large-allocation-request-preparation-instructions.md)
for preparing the required Request Summary document.

If your Request Summary is ready, [submit your Large Allocation Request
here](https://arc.ucar.edu/xras_submit/opportunities).

Large allocations are made for the duration of the supporting NSF award.
If the NSF award is extended, including no-cost extensions, you can ask
for your allocation end date to be extended as well. At the end of your
NSF award, you can request three extra months to wrap things up, and
with concurrence from the NSF Program Officer, we can extend your
allocation up to 12 months beyond the end of your NSF award.

## Small Allocations

**Small requests can be submitted at any time and decisions are
typically made within a few days.**

U.S. university researchers who are supported by an NSF award can
request an initial small allocation of up to 1 million core-hours on Derecho;
and up to 2,500 GPU-hours on Derecho for each NSF award. These allocations
can be used to complete small projects or to conduct initial runs in
preparation for submitting a request for a large allocation. As noted above,
the NSF award must explicitly support the computational experiments conducted
with the small allocation.

If needed to complete your work, you can request a *one-time supplement*
to a small allocation – as much as doubling the total hours available
for your project – with a brief statement that you are on track to
finish or that you are aware you will need to prepare a large allocation
proposal for any additional resources. You may also request a large
allocation at any point after receiving a small allocation.

Small allocations are also made for the duration of the supporting NSF
award, and they can be extended according to the same rules as for large
allocations.

here](https://arc.ucar.edu/xras_submit/opportunities).

## Exploratory Allocations

!!! info "Exploratory requests from unsponsored graduate students, postdocs, and new faculty can be submitted at any time and decisions are typically made within a few days."

A graduate student, post-doctoral researcher, or new faculty member at a
U.S. university can request a one-time allocation of up to 500,000 Derecho
core-hours or 1,500 Derecho GPU-hours. These awards typically support
dissertations, help foster early career research, or provide seed resources
for pursuing funded research.

An individual can request a new exploratory project at each stage of
their career path. A new faculty member is any eligible researcher who
has not previously had an NSF NCAR allocation as a faculty member.

For these allocations, in addition to meeting the domain and affiliation
eligibility requirements (below):

- The work must be the individual's own research project rather than a
  project assigned by the institution that is hosting the grad student,
  postdoc, or faculty member.

- The work should not lie within the scope of any funded grant.

- A letter from the individual’s advisor or department head must affirm
  the quality of the proposed research and that the work is not within
  the scope of a funded grant.

If needed to complete your work, you can request a one-time supplement
of the allocation, up to twice the original amount, with a brief
statement acknowledging that you will finish within the supplemental
amount.

Exploratory requests are accepted at any time and decisions are
typically made within a few days. Exploratory allocations are made for
one year, but may be extended up to two additional years to complete the
original project.

here](https://arc.ucar.edu/xras_submit/opportunities).

## Data Analysis Allocations (NEW!)

!!! info "Data Analysis allocation requests can be submitted at any time and decisions are typically made within a few days."

Earth system scientists can request access to NSF NCAR’s
[Casper data analysis cluster](../../compute-systems/casper/index.md) and the
[Campaign Storage file system](../../storage-systems/glade/index.md#campaign-storage-space)
to allow them to conduct analyses on data sets curated by
[NSF NCAR data services](https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/computing-data/data) and accessible
via our storage systems.

We are pleased to make Data Analysis allocations available to
researchers from any eligible institution *regardless of the source of
funding* for the planned analysis. Researchers are only required to
identify the specific NSF NCAR-hosted data sets that are essential to
completing their science objectives. (Because of this expanded
eligibility, Data Analysis projects cannot make use of Derecho.) In
addition, Data Analysis projects may request Campaign Storage space
to temporarily store external datasets beyond the NCAR-hosted datasets
being analyzed.

Data Analysis allocations are made for one year, but may be extended up
to two additional years to complete the project.

Requests for the CMIP Analysis Platform, unless the work requires use of
NSF NCAR’s HPC resource, fall within the scope of a Data Analysis project.

[Submit a Data Analysis Allocation Request
here](https://arc.ucar.edu/xras_submit/opportunities).

## Classroom Allocations

!!! info "Classroom Allocation Requests can be submitted at any time and decisions are generally made within a few days."

CISL offers opportunities to undergraduate and graduate faculty and
instructors at U.S. 2- and 4-year institutions to use NSF NCAR HPC and
analysis resources in their courses in Earth system science and related
areas. “Special projects” or honors thesis courses under the guidance of
a faculty member are eligible.

Classroom allocations can also be used for shorter-term training courses
and workshops aimed at the university community with the goal of
developing a skilled workforce relevant to all aspects of NSF NCAR’s
mission.

Individual accounts are provided to all students and the instructor(s),
so be sure to allow at least a week for setting up accounts. Very large
classes may require more setup time. NSF NCAR can provide consulting
assistance to the instructors.

Classroom allocations are typically made for the duration of the course,
plus a reasonable limited period afterwards.

## Eligibility Details

NSF NCAR’s HPC environment represents a significant resource for the U.S.
university community. Access to the environment is governed by three
primary eligibility criteria.

### 1. Earth system science and related research

To use NSF NCAR resources, a project must be within Earth system science or
be Earth system–related research.

According to a recent report from the National Academies, “Earth system
science” aims to discover and integrate knowledge on the structure,
nature, and scales of the dynamics and interactions among natural and
social processes throughout the Earth system, which includes the
atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, as well as
the individuals, institutions, and technologies that respond to and
influence these dynamics and their interactions and feedback through
time.

Because scientific progress often relies on contributions from many
fields, NSF NCAR resources are also available to support Earth
system–related work from other domains – that is, work that has a
demonstrable benefit to or reliance on Earth system science.

### 2. Affiliation

A prime component of NSF NCAR’s mission is to support Earth systems
science at U.S. post-secondary educational institutions. Eligible
institutions encompass 2- and 4-year colleges and universities,
including community colleges, predominantly undergraduate-serving institutions, and
non-profit research organizations. Recipients of NSF research grants in
eligible domains from other types of institutions are also deemed eligible.
NSF NCAR resources normally do not support research groups in federal
agencies.

### 3. Sponsorship

**NSF grants.** Researchers can apply for an NSF NCAR allocation in support
of an associated NSF grant for Earth system science or related research
as long as their proposed computing supports the objectives of the
grant. The NSF is kept informed to ensure appropriate use of NSF NCAR
resources.

**Unsponsored projects.** NSF NCAR provides opportunities for graduate
students, postdocs, and new faculty at eligible institutions for work
not within the scope of a funded research grant. For this purpose, “new
faculty” includes any faculty member who has not previously had a
university allocation at NSF NCAR.

- The work must be the individual's own research project rather than a
  project assigned by the institution that is hosting the grad student,
  postdoc, or faculty member.

- Their work should not lie within the scope of any funded grant.

- They must provide a letter from their advisor or department head
  commenting on the quality of the proposed research and affirming that
  funds are not within the scope of a funded grant.

Unsponsored researchers may also request Data Analysis allocations.
These projects cannot use NSF NCAR HPC resources and must make use of
NSF NCAR-hosted data sets.

**Non-NSF funding**

Due to high demand for NSF NCAR resources at this time, we are unable to
provide HPC support to Earth system scientists who have funding solely
from non-NSF sources. However, researchers who want to analyze NSF NCAR data
sets can request use of NSF NCAR analysis resources regardless of their
funding source.

The [University of Wyoming allocation
opportunity](http://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/) has eligibility criteria that
permit funding by sources other than NSF, for projects involving U
Wyoming collaborators.
