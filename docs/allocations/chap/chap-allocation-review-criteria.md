# CHAP: Allocation Review Criteria

The CISL HPC Allocations Panel (CHAP) assesses the merits of large computing requests from U.S.
university researchers for use of CISL supercomputing resources.
Computing requests are accepted in the atmospheric and closely related
sciences for projects that are supported by the National Science
Foundation. The panel recommends action with respect to a prospective user's request
on the basis of the computational experimental design, computational
effectiveness, and availability of computing resources as described
below.

## Overall context

As part of reviewing the merits of requests for CISL resource
allocations, the CHAP and CISL allocations staff will ensure that:

- All requests for resources that exceed a threshold level determined by
  CISL and the CHAP shall be peer-reviewed.

- Written reviews of the resource requests shall be completed in a
  timely way and made available to the requesters.

- Recommendations to CISL management for the allocation of resources
  based on the requests, reviews, and available resources shall be
  documented.

- The allocations process shall be consistent with
  the [conflict-of-interest policy](chap-conflict-of-interest-policy.md) and
  shall maintain confidentiality of requesters and their reviews.

## Purpose and scope of reviews

In its review of allocation proposals, the CHAP verifies the suitability
of the work for CISL resources, considers the ability of the research
team to complete the work, and most significantly, reviews the merit of
the proposed computational plan.

### Scientific eligibility

A request for resources will succinctly state the scientific impact of
the research to be conducted and the existing merit-reviewed support for
the research *as demonstrated by current financial support from NSF. The
scientific merit and approach will not be subject to further review by
the CHAP.* Since NSF NCAR computing resources are provided specifically 
for Earth system science and related sciences, the request must fall
within these areas.

### Merit review criteria
The justification of the resource request will be reviewed against three
criteria, which apply to both computational and storage resources, with
the level of scrutiny for the review rising with the size of the requested
resources.

#### ***Effectiveness of methodology***
For computational resource requests, the choice of applications,
methods, algorithms, and techniques to be employed to accomplish the
stated scientific objectives should be reasonably described and
motivated. For data storage resource requests, the data to be stored
should be reasonably described and motivated with respect to the
stated research objectives.

#### ***Appropriateness of research plan***
The steps in the research plan should explain how the scientific
objectives will be achieved. For computational experiments, the
proposed computations should encompass simulation parameters (grid
size, time scale, ensemble parameters, and so on) that are needed to
obtain accurate and meaningful results, as well as the human resources
that can be devoted to the task. For storage resources, the
justification should describe the rationale for determining which data
will be stored. The amount of resources (of all types) requested
should be derived from the methodology and research plan. If there are
serious concerns about the research plan, reviewers should share their
concerns with the proposer and may decide to proceed only after the
concerns have been addressed.

#### ***Efficiency of resource use***
The resources requested should be used as efficiently as is reasonably
possible and in accordance with the recommended use guidelines of
those resources. In exceptional cases, where the reviewers conclude
that the proposed methods are so inefficient that they amount to a
waste of public resources, they should not approve the request until
the proposer has addressed their concerns. For computational
resources, performance and parallel scaling data should be provided
along with a discussion of optimization or other work done to improve
the applications. For storage resources, the CHAP will consider the
choices made in managing the project's data, efforts made to reduce 
the project's storage footprint, the value of that data both within 
the proposing research team and among the wider community, approaches 
for data access and dissemination, and long-term retention plans.

### Prior accomplishments

For ongoing computational activities, the CHAP will consider the
progress made using prior allocations, including the publication of
peer-reviewed manuscripts, other communications within the community,
and the effective estimation and use of CISL resources from prior
requests.
