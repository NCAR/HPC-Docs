# CISL HPC Allocations Panel

## Overview
CISL's advisory panel on high-performance computing and services is the
CISL HPC Allocations Panel (CHAP). The CHAP's primary responsibility is
to assess the merit of large computing requests for CISL supercomputers
and related resources.

NSF NCAR accepts computing proposals from U.S. university researchers
in the Earth system sciences and closely related sciences who are 
supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). The CHAP 
recommends action with respect to a prospective user's request on 
the basis of the computational experimental design, computational 
effectiveness, and availability of computing resources.

!!! note
    The next university deadline for submitting Large Allocation Requests is March 12, 2024.

CHAP members, most of whom are from the university community, are
appointed to three-year terms by the CISL Director. Meetings are
scheduled twice a year, usually in April and October. NSF's program
coordinator for the NSF NCAR and Facilities Section attends the semi-annual
meetings and provides guidance from the NSF.
