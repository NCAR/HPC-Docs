# Duo: Getting started with two-factor authentication

To get started, contact CISL to request enrollment (and to get a CIT
password if you don't already have one).

CISL will send you a link for setting up a Duo account.

During setup, Duo asks some questions about the device you want to use.
Smartphone and tablet users are asked to download the [free **<u>Duo
Mobile</u>** app](https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile).

When your setup is complete, follow the instructions below to log in to
the system, such as Cheyenne, the NCAR virtual private network, or
others that accept Duo 2FA.

## Logging in with Duo

### HPC and SSH logins

To log in to a system like Cheyenne:

- Enter your **ssh** command.

- Enter your **CIT password** where a token response is requested.

The Duo App will send a "push" notification to your phone or tablet,
asking you to approve or deny the login request.

When you approve the request, you will be logged in.

### Other application logins

Duo authentication with other systems is somewhat different. Logging on
to the NCAR virtual private network
([VPN](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/user-support/vpn-access)) is one
example.

  the Duo screen.

The Duo App will send a push notification to your phone or tablet,
asking you to approve or deny the login request.

When you approve the request, you will be logged in.
