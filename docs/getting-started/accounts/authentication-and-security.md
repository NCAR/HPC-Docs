# Authentication and security

Individuals who are granted access to the computing and storage
resources that CISL manages use their assigned user names and one of the
authentication methods that are described below to log in to those
systems.

Passwords, apps, tokens, and PINs must be protected and may not be
shared with anyone. If sharing is detected, CISL will disable the
accounts of those involved. The same applies to passwords that give
users access to internal UCAR systems.

UCAR and NCAR computers, computing systems, and associated
communications systems are to be used for official business only. By
signing the required authentication acknowledgement form, you agree not
to misuse these resources, and you accept responsibility for activity
associated with your username and token. You also agree not to duplicate
or use copyrighted or proprietary software without proper authorization.

## Duo two-factor authentication

Logging in with the Duo two-factor authentication (2FA) service requires
the user to enter a [CIT password](cit-passwords.md) in conjunction with the **Duo
Mobile** app or a landline phone. See [Authenticating with Duo](duo/index.md) for details.

## Security overview

All users must comply with UCAR computer security policies and
procedures. See [Access to and Use of Information Systems and Technology Infrastructure](https://sundog.ucar.edu/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=5141)
(staff login required).

We strive to maximize the availability and value of our computer and
network systems by protecting them from unauthorized access. Good
security practices help prevent data loss or corruption, malicious
activity, and loss of computer time.

As a user, you have an important role in ensuring the security of these
resources. In addition to protecting the passwords, PINS, and tokens
that give you access to our systems, we ask that you do the following:

### Loss, theft, or compromise

Loss, theft, or compromise of a YubiKey must be reported within 48 hours
to the Research Computing Help Desk at x2400 (303-497-2400). Quick
reporting will help the organization minimize security risk.

### Protecting your Duo app or YubiKey token

You must protect your Duo or YubiKey solution by agreeing to the
following:

- Your YubiKey token or Duo application will remain in your custody and
  is for your use only; it may not be shared.

- You will immediately (within 48 hours) report loss of custody of your
  hardware authentication token to the Research Computing Help Desk at
  x2400 (303-497-2400). Loss of custody may be due to loss or theft.

- Your PIN number or CIT password may not be shared or made available in
  unencrypted electronic form.

- Compromise (disclosure of PIN number or CIT password) must be reported
  to the Research Computing Help Desk at x2400 (303-497-2400) and/or to
  the UCAR Security Operations Center at x4300 (307-996-4300).

### Protect your PIN

Do not leave your PIN where others may view it, and do not affix it to
your workstation or your token. Do not use the same PIN that you use for
debit cards or credit cards.

Try to memorize your PIN instead of writing it down. You may write it
down, but do not store it with the token. If you do write it down, keep
it where others cannot access it, such as in a locked desk drawer or
file cabinet that only you can access.

### Use encryption for logging in and transferring files

Our systems require this, but it also is good practice to use encryption
for other computers and systems.

### Patch your systems and use anti-virus software

This applies to any computer from which you log in to UCAR and NCAR
systems. If you are using your own personal computer or another non-UCAR
or non-NCAR computer, be sure that it is kept up to date with the latest
software patches and anti-virus protection.

If you are planning to visit UCAR and bringing your own computer,
discuss wireless and guest network access with your UCAR contact before
you arrive. Procedures regarding guest network access also apply to
personally owned computers that UCAR and NCAR staff bring in.

### Be careful

Be aware of email scams and so-called "social engineering" methods that
hackers and fraudsters use to gain access to passwords and other
information. Never give anyone your password. UCAR and NCAR system
administrators will not ask you for your password via phone or email.

### Other cautions

- Don't run strange binaries or executables.

- Don't log in to sites that you receive in email or other messages,
  especially if the message seems urgent and you are not familiar with
  the site.

- Some malware is spread via USB flash drives, so make sure any flash
  drives that you use are from trusted sources.
