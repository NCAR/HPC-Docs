# Acknowledging NSF NCAR and CISL

A requirement of all allocations and use of NSF NCAR HPC resources managed
by CISL, including the CMIP Analysis Platform and Research Data Archive,
is to acknowledge NSF NCAR support for your research. Our ability
to identify supported scientific results helps ensure continued support
from NSF and other sources for future HPC systems.

Each year, CISL conducts a survey of its user community to collect published 
works resulting from use of NSF NCARâ€™s HPC environment. Responding to this 
survey helps us capture and track the scientific impact of these critical services.

We also appreciate hearing about your scientific successes at any time. 
If your institution prepares a press release or news story about your work 
using NSF NCAR resources, please contact us at <alloc@ucar.edu> so we can help 
promote your work.

More details follow below for appropriate ways to acknowledge Derecho, 
Cheyenne, Yellowstone, and CMIP Analysis Platform projects, and for 
the use of Research Data Archive data sets.

## For Derecho projects

### Citation formats
You can cite your use of the Derecho system and/or the Casper data analysis 
and visualization cluster with the following formats, based on the source of 
your allocation and modified as needed to conform with citation style guidelines. 
Be sure to use the digital object identifier (DOI) as shown; it is unique to Derecho.

1. Computational and Information Systems Laboratory. 2023.
   Derecho: HPE Cray EX System (University Community Computing). 
   Boulder, CO: NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research. 
   [doi:10.5065/qx9a-pg09](https://doi.org/10.5065/qx9a-pg09).
2. Computational and Information Systems Laboratory. 2023. 
   Derecho: HPE Cray EX System (NCAR Community Computing). 
   Boulder, CO: National Center for Atmospheric Research. 
   [doi:10.5065/qx9a-pg09](https://doi.org/10.5065/qx9a-pg09).
3. Computational and Information Systems Laboratory. 2023. 
   Derecho: HPE Cray EX System (Wyoming-NCAR Alliance). 
   Boulder, CO: National Center for Atmospheric Research. 
   [doi:10.5065/qx9a-pg09](https://doi.org/10.5065/qx9a-pg09).

### Acknowledgments
Acknowledgments are more difficult to track electronically due to the many possible 
variations, but you may choose to acknowledge support from Derecho if the citation 
method described above is inappropriate. You may modify the following examples as 
appropriate; however, please include at least the DOI in the acknowledgment text, 
as you would include funding agency award numbers.

#### For University/CHAP and NCAR allocations
*We would like to acknowledge high-performance computing support from the Derecho 
system ([doi:10.5065/qx9a-pg09](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/74317833)) provided by the NSF National Center for Atmospheric 
Research (NCAR), sponsored by the National Science Foundation.*

#### For Wyoming-NCAR Alliance allocations
*We would like to acknowledge the use of the Derecho system ([doi:10.5065/qx9a-pg09](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/74317833)) 
supported by the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) at the 
NSF NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center, sponsored by the National Science Foundation 
and the State of Wyoming.*

## For Cheyenne projects
If you are publishing a work that used the Cheyenne resource, follow the guidance for Derecho above, 
but use the appropriate calendar year, "Cheyenne: HPE/SGI ICE XA System" for the system name, and 
the Cheyenne DOI ([doi:10.5065/D6RX99HX](https://doi.org/10.5065/D6RX99HX)).

## For Yellowstone projects
If you are publishing a work that used the Yellowstone resource, follow
the guidance for Derecho, but use 2016 for the citation year,
"Yellowstone: IBM iDataPlex System" for the system name, and the
Yellowstone ARK (<http://n2t.net/ark:/85065/d7wd3xhc>) for the DOI.

## For CMIP Analysis Platform projects
See this [CMIP Analysis Platform
documentation](https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/cmip-analysis-platform#terms) for
how to acknowledge NSF NCAR/CISL support and for information on other
requirements related to the use of CMIP data.

## For use of RDA data sets
We ask that you cite the dataset(s) used. Citations templates are
provided on the relevant RDA dataset home pages. For an example, see the
"How to Cite This Dataset" section
on <https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds094.0/citation>.

Computational and Information Systems Laboratory at the NSF National Center 
for Atmospheric Research. NSF NCAR is supported by grants from the 
National Science Foundation.
