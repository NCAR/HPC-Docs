# Acknowledging NCAR and CISL

A requirement of all allocations and use of NCAR HPC resources managed
by CISL, including the CMIP Analysis Platform and Research Data Archive,
is to acknowledge NCAR and CISL support for your research. Our ability
to identify supported scientific results helps ensure continued support
from NSF and other sources for future HPC systems.

Upon completion of your project, NCAR requires an accomplishment report
containing:

1. The research results obtained using NCAR resources,
2. a list of scientific publications that resulted from this research,
3. the names and affiliations of graduate students who used NCAR resources, and
4. the title, author, and relevant citation data for any theses or dissertations produced using NCAR computational resources.

The accomplishment report should be sent as a PDF to <alloc@ucar.edu>.

!!! note
    A PI’s or project lead’s subsequent allocations may be delayed pending compliance with these reporting requirements.

More details follow below for Derecho, Cheyenne, Yellowstone, and CMIP
Analysis Platform projects, and for the use of Research Data Archive
data sets.

## For Derecho projects

If you are publishing a work that uses the Derecho resource, follow the
guidance for Cheyenne below, but use the appropriate calendar year,
"Derecho: HPE Cray EX System" for the system name, and the Derecho DOI
(<https://doi.org/10.5065/qx9a-pg09>).

### Citation formats
We prefer that you *cite* your use of the
Derecho system (and/or the Casper data analysis and visualization
cluster) with the following citation formats, based on the source of
your allocation and modified as needed to conform with citation style
guidelines. Be sure to use the digital object identifier (DOI) as shown;
it is unique to Derecho.
