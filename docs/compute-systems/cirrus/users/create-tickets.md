    We try to allow any user the ability to create tickets but if you don't have proper permissions 
    create a ticket <a href="https://ithelp.ucar.edu/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/create/17">here</a> and a Jira administrator will grant access to the CIRRUS project.

### Ticket Field Information
The Project and Issue Type are selected by default.

- Summary: For the Summary field put in a short description of the issue you are having.
- Reporter: The Reporter field is not filled automatically. Please search for and select your name.
- Description: Include detail about your issue here. Please include any error messages or information you think is relevant. 
- Attachment: Please use this field to upload any relevant images or files. Instead of pasting lines of logs directly in to the description upload a text file here and reference it. 
- Assignee: This is set to Automatic by default. Please leave it and the teams Product Owner will make sure it is assigned accordingly.  
- Epic Link: By default this is User Requests. Please leave it. 

When you select the `Create` button you will be redirected to the `Issues` page with your new ticket being display. It is now in the team backlog. You will get an email, it will also be sent to the [Product Owner](agile.md#via-the-agile-product-owner-po) for the team, that confirms your ticket has been created with the content supplied. This will also contain a link to your issue that hopefully makes it easier to check in and get updates.
