# Create Tickets in Jira

The CIRRUS team uses **Jira** to track and manage all requests, issues, and service deployments. Tickets created in Jira follow the team’s <span title="Kanban: Agile framework that visualizes work on a board and limits WIP."><strong>Kanban</strong></span> workflow, ensuring visibility and accountability throughout the lifecycle of your request.

## Jira Authentication

If you are not logged into Jira or lack the proper permissions, you may encounter an error when accessing the ticket-creation page.

**Solution:** Click the **Login** link and you’ll be automatically redirected back to the *Create Issue* screen.  
If access is denied, submit an [access-request ticket](https://ithelp.ucar.edu/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/create/17) and a Jira administrator will grant you permission to the CIRRUS project.
